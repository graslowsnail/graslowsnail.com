**Why…**

Why did I jump?

---
---

At the time, I was only worried about how high the platform was from the water. I didn’t even think about sticking the landing, or what would come after that.

Now you’re telling me I have no other option but to swim? I have no idea how long I’ll have to swim for — my arms and legs are getting tired quick. With each breath I take, I’m inhaling more water than air.

I think to myself how bad this feels and ask myself:

**Why…**

Why did I jump?

---
---

In asking why, I found my answer.

---
---

Did I jump to regret my decision? **No.** I knew it would be hard. I jumped because the person who was on the platform knew —

---
---

**This was the only way.**

---
---

How else would I reach the horizon?

---
---

Ahhh, that’s right — I remember **I CAN SWIM.**

---
---

Will I make it? Who knows. Maybe a shark eats me before I get there. Maybe I die from exhaustion and end up on the ocean floor. Who cares — ‘cause one day, everybody’s gotta die.

---
---

At least I’ll go out with a bang. Maybe I make it, maybe I don’t. But one thing’s for sure: **at least I tried.** Not only for me, but for those still standing on the platform, waiting for the perfect moment to jump.

---
---

This is my life now — I am a swimmer. And I will swim until I can’t swim anymore.
