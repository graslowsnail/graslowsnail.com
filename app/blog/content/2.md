Hey, I've been meaning to talk to you about something that's been on my mind.

Look, I don't want to waste any of your time, and honestly, I don't think we should see each other anymore. I think this relationship has taken a toll on me in a negative way.

I constantly panic if you're not by my side. I glance at you every second I can. I get lost in your eyes for endless hours.

You honestly bring out the worst in me...

I find myself staying up late, losing sleep over you. In the morning, the first thing that comes to my mind is YOU, and I panic if you're not by my side. I could lay there for hours with you, even if I know I have plenty to do.

You're perfect, your looks, your sense of humor. In every way, you're perfect. But when I'm with you, I constantly seek your validation, and put you fist. My life revolves around you. I spend almost every hour I'm awake with you.

I can't do this anymore. There are things that I like to do, places I want to see, dreams I want to fulfillâ€”and our relationship is taking that away from me. Even though you give me the freedom to do whatever I want, I still feel chained to you, and I've had enough.

So, iPhone, I'm breaking up with you.
