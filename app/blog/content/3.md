title: Growing pains.

I forget a lot of things. I'm not the best at remembering names or birthdays (I don't even have my mom's memorized). But one thing that always hits me like a truck: **the growing pains**. Sometimes they feel good, and other times they feel super shitty. Especially when you're doing something that's *wayyyyy* out of your comfort zone. Like what I'm doing right now.

Last month, a good friend of mine told me about a program that, when I looked into it, I knew I **NEEDED** to attend.

> It was do or die.

Today I'm done with my first week and man, I’ve been surprising myself.

**3 months**, **10-hour workdays**, **1,684 miles** from my family and the house I grew up in — reality is starting to sink in. I'm probably going to start a new life here and leave the old life I used to know back home.

**Chasing your dreams** sounds fun and romantic, until you actually start the journey and realize what you signed up for.

And honestly... I'm okay with that. Over time, you slowly start to adjust to the mayhem around you — to the point where it becomes your new reality.

I think everyone should **chase their dreams** — otherwise, you might regret it when you're taking your final breaths.
