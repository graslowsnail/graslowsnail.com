What have you craved most in your life so far?

Me personally, it’s been success, money, and notoriety. Or so I thought. It’s kinda funny how, when you’re young (I’m “only” 25 lol), those things feel so important. But now that I’m in the second half of my 20s, I find myself craving something different.

I just want to live a life true to myself. What do I mean by that? I want to chase my dreams, accomplish goals I’ve set for myself, and do that while being a *good person* (whatever that means). For example, when I dropped out of college, I was called a loser, lazy, and that I was making a mistake.

I think it’s easy in this crazy life to let the world influence you. Whether that is telling you your dreams are stupid, you’re wasting your time, you should just do what *Fulano* (Mexican John Doe) is doing. And sadly, many people fall victim to the outside voices, and I don’t blame them.

When you’re treading uncharted territory, pretty much everything is going to try to stop you—even yourself. But when you want something so badly, you can feel it pulling you, even if you can’t touch it yet.

That’s when you know you’re on the right path for you. What do you crave enough to follow?
